# Bit Rush Unlimited
> 2D Mobile Platformer made in Unity

This game is a new update of "Bit Rush", a buggy and removed Play Store title.

It uses a raycast system instead of Unity Physics for smooth and tight platforming. 

With improved 2D Pixel Graphics instead of the in-built Unity sprites in the original, added URP lighting using 2D normal maps to emulate the style of dead cells, and other post-processing, it aims to be a much more visually appealing title on the store.

What sets it apart from titles like Geometry Dash? Instead of endless scrolling, the player has full agency of movement. The timer doesn't start until the player taps the controls on the screen. This makes it momentum, puzzle, and time based so that the same levels can be beaten in MULTIPLE ways using creativity/skill to finish in less time.

## Planned Features
1. Multiplayer Leaderboards
2. Level Editor with Shareable Levels
3. Cosmetics Shop (Everything is earnable without real money)
4. Optional Reward Ads (Never Forced)
5. Localization

## TBD Features
1. Spin The Wheel (Daily for Free)
2. Missions/Rewards
3. Season Pass
4. Endless Mode (Procedural Generation)
5. Leaderboards/Leagues (Points for each level completion, scaled down with number of attempts)

NOTE: ALL added features will make sure that Free-To-Play is viable, and never compromise the integrity of the gameplay.
